Resin SDK
---------

The NodeJS Resin SDK.

## Future

In the future, we'd like this SDK to run both in the server (in NodeJS) as well as on the browser (in Browserify). That'd allow us to reuse a big portion of code between the frontend, the CLI and other future tools.

## Documentation

Open `doc/index.html` in a web browser to view a detailed documentation of the capabilities offered by the SDK.

## Development

Run:

```sh
$ gulp watch
```
